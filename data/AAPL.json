Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Mysten Labs co-founder and CEO Evan Cheng. Cheng has spent good chunks of time in tech leadership roles at Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META). Since 2021, he has been building the Web3 platform Mylen Labs. The timing looks to have been spot on, as the crypto space has notched several wins under the Trump administration. With President Trump leaning into making the US the bitcoin (BTC-USD) capital of the world, what does it mean for Web3 early entrants such as Mylen Labs? Cheng weighs in,and shares how leadership lessons learned at Apple and Meta are paying dividends at his startup.

Some of those alleged worst offenders are important sourcing and business regions for many large US companies such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), and Walmart (WMT). China, for example, will see an estimated reciprocal tariff of 34%. Vietnam at 32%. Japan is at 24%. The news has hit stocks, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down about 1,200 points, or nearly 3% (YM=F). S&P 500 futures are down 3.5% (ES=F), and Nasdaq futures are off by 3.8% (NQ=F). Japan\u2019s Nikkei (^N225) and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (^HSI) have also registered significant losses. Here\u2019s the hot analysis investors need to know right now:First, retail stocks are getting battered. Walmart, Nike, and Under Armour (UAA, UA) are getting slammed as steep tariffs on China could hammer profits. Nike, for example, relies on China and Vietnam for 55% of its sourcing. Stifel analyst Jim Duffy estimates Nike could see $1.69 a share in earnings wiped out this year because of tariffs. Next up, Apple is going to have a rough day: Morgan Stanley estimates that the tariffs on iPhones and other devices from China will increase Apple\u2019s annual costs by a whopping $8.5 billion. That could hit Apple\u2019s profits by 52 cents next year. Brutal. And lastly, the technical takedown: Market technicians are locked in on the S&P 500\u2019s March 13 closing low of 5,527.50. At this moment, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is poised to test that low. A break through below the March lows intraday coupled with a new closing low could really damage sentiment further pros warn. RBC strategist Lori Calvasina says the S&P 500 has a clear shot to 4,900 if that low is breached. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here.",
