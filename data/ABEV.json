Airfreight, obviously, is terrific, but it's more expensive\u2026 If this strike continues, it will, almost without a doubt, have a direct impact on consumers being able to buy their favorite distilled spirits brands as gifts.\u201d Swonger says \u201cThere's strong interest in all parties involved with this and we certainly recognize and appreciate those hard workers that get the products off the ships and on the trucks that go out to American citizens around the country. We just really hope this gets resolved sooner rather than later.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.
