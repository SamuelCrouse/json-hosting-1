            "headline": "As cryptocurrency regulation is expected to ease under the incoming Trump administration, Clear Street senior research analyst Brian Dobson joins Market Domination to analyze crypto mining prospects for 2025. \"Not all miners are created equal,\" Dobson tells Yahoo Finance. He distinguishes between two types: those capable of pivoting to high-performance computing, and efficient operators focused on balance-sheet management. Dobson identifies CleanSpark (CLSK.MX, CLSK) as a leading player in the crypto mining sector, citing its \"best-in-class management team, very efficient mining fleet,\" and strong EBITDA generation potential. Looking ahead to the new administration, Dobson anticipates the Securities and Exchange Commission might approve in-kind exchanges, enabling bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners to convert their coins into bitcoin ETF shares and benefit from securities lending income.
