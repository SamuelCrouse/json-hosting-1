Although gold prices also rose last year, miners still struggled to offset inflation-driven spikes in labour and fuel costs while facing regulatory hurdles such as tax disputes in Mali and project delays in Canada.  As a result, investors mostly shunned equity funds focused on gold miners, opting instead for traditional gold funds that offered a safe haven during the Russia-Ukraine war and escalating trade tariff concerns after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in early November.",
