            "headline": "Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) are getting clobbered on Friday. It comes after the tech giant reported underwhelming first quarter results and issued disappointing guidance. In an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, HPE CEO Antonio Neri says that for the first quarter, the \"disappointment was on one specific metric, which was the server operative margins, which came below what the Street had in their consensus. And that had to do with the fact that we found a couple of issues that we could have executed better.\" On the outlook, Neri mentioned a number of issues that are weighing on the business, including tariffs.
