There isn\u2019t much Pat Gelsinger hasn\u2019t done in the tech industry. He created cutting-edge technology decades ago at Intel (INTC). Then went off to VMware to reinvent the tech player. He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsinger\u2019s tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.
