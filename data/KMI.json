While Kinder Morgan does not expect tariffs to have a significant impact on project economics, it said the uncertainty sparked by them, along with commodity prices, caused the company to be \"a little bit more conservative\" in communicating its annual outlook.  It expects to post an adjusted profit of $1.27 per share in 2025.",
