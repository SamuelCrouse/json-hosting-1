The technology giant's greenhouse gas emissions were 29.1% higher than 2020 levels last year amid growing demand for energy for artificial intelligence uses and it last reported annual greenhouse gas emissions of 17.2 million tons at the end of 2023.  The bioenergy carbon capture and storage project being developed by carbon capture company AtmosClear is located at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will use materials like sugarcane bagasse and forest trimmings to generate energy and capture the associated carbon emissions and store them underground.",
