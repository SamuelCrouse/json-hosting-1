Nvidia announced that its Blackwell chips, the company's current most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), will be produced entirely in the U.S. Now, this isn't happening tomorrow, but its production is expected to ramp up in the next 12 to 15 months.  Components for these GPUs will come from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM) chip facility in Phoenix, Foxconn's facility in Houston, and Wistron's facility in Dallas, with final assembly occurring in Nvidia's plant in Texas.",
