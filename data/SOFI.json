As of this writing, SoFi's stock price has fallen by 37% since it reached its peak in January, even after a recent rebound, despite reporting its first full profitable year ever as well as excellent momentum throughout its business.  To be sure, SoFi's earnings report gave investors some concerns about profit margins, and the business can certainly be hurt by the trade war.",
