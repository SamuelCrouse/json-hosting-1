Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz joins Market Domination to elaborate on this. \"I don't know how it all balances out because there are too many variables and too much uncertainty and too much flip flopping in terms of these policies,\" Kantrowitz says. \"So, ultimately, as an investor, I think the way you want to think about it, since there is a lot of uncertainty, is really watch how it impacts interest rates. Because at the end of the day, it's not tariffs that are the problem \u2014 it's that if tariffs lead to inflation and push interest rates higher, that becomes the problem.\" Kantrowitz suggests avoiding stocks with poor fundamentals, particularly small-cap stocks (^RUT, ^SP600) that are sensitive to interest rate changes, and instead focusing on larger companies or an equal-weighted S&P index (^SPXEW, ^SP500EW).

The pair explored how psychology, Federal Reserve policy, and the rise of algorithms contribute to the unpredictable ups and downs of the market. Johnson pointed out the market\u2019s tendency to overreact to good news, which often triggers fears of inflation and interest rate hikes. \u201cYou buy stocks because of earnings growth, not because you think the Fed's going to cut rates,\u201d Johnson said, urging investors to focus on long-term fundamentals instead of speculation. Polcari echoed this but stressed the importance of caution. \u201cYou should understand what the economy is doing around you before you just haphazardly go and start buying stocks,\u201d he advised, noting the impact inflation could have on stock selection and timing. The conversation also highlighted the role of algorithms in driving erratic market movements. Johnson explained that pre-programmed systems often respond automatically to data, amplifying volatility. Polcari added that fear indicators like the VIX crossing 22 can set off sell programs, leading to further market turbulence. Both agreed that if the 10-year Treasury yield hits 5%, it could spell trouble for stocks, especially if inflation surges or economic growth slows.

TMX VettaFi head of research Todd Rosenbluth sits down with Seana Smith on Catalysts as part of the ETF report to discuss how the downward spiral showcases the dangers of investing in ETFs tied to a single stock. \"I think it was a wake-up call,\" Rosenbluth says, adding \"We've seen a lot of money going into single-stock leveraged ETFs ...We've seen a lot of money going into those megacap growth-oriented strategies. We think this is a good time for investors to remember diversification and diversification benefits.\" \"Artificial intelligence [AI] is a mega trend theme that's going to resonate not only in 2025 but beyond,\" the analyst says, noting \"There are more diversified ways to get exposure using ETFs.\" He highlights the Robo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ) as an option for investors to play the AI trend without sacrificing diversity in their portfolio.
