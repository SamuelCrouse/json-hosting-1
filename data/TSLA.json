                "headline": "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. With all due respect to JPMorgan (JPM) and Netflix (NFLX), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker\u2019s stock has been run over since President Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It\u2019s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public\u2019s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. \u201cThe turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,\u201d tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock:  Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Tesla\u2019s business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track.
