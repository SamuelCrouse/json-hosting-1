The path to renewed sales and profit growth won\u2019t be easy, however. The Tesla brand will likely continue to feel blowback from Musk\u2019s outspokenness on government policies. At the same time, tariff policy stands to hammer margins given Tesla\u2019s exposure to solar panels from China and autos being made outside the US.
