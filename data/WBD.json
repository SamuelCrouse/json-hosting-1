            "headline": "This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano takes a look at some of this week\u2019s biggest headlines in the sports business world that you and your portfolio need to know. From Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) scaling back its sports media rights to the MLB Players Association bracing for another lockout, the financial landscape of professional sports continues to shift. Plus, the Caitlin Clark effect continues as the Chicago Sky moves its matchups against the Indiana Fever to a larger venue to accommodate for an increase in fan attendance. Here's what you need to know: Warner Bros. Discovery cuts back on sports Following their fourth quarter earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told investors WBD will be prioritizing intellectual property (IP) from film and TV properties that the company can own versus sports media rights. Zaslav said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more sports anywhere in the world in order to support our business.\u201d Though WBD will be losing the NBA after this season when their media rights deal ends, the company still owns the rights to the NHL, tennis French Open, NASCAR, Unrivaled women\u2019s basketball league, and All Elite Wrestling. MLB Players Association expects lockout in next round of CBA negotiations The MLB is currently in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations for 2026 and the union is anticipating an offseason lockout. The last time the league faced a lockout was in 2021 and it delayed the 2022 season by a week. MLBPA Executive Director Tony Clark says 2026 CBA negotiations will start this coming spring and if a new CBA is not signed by December 1, the MLB will likely enter a lockout. Chicago Sky moves Caitlin Clark & Indiana Fever games to the United Center It\u2019s the Caitlin Clark effect all over again. Chicago Sky announced they will be moving their two home games against the Indiana Fever from the Wintrust Arena to the United Center. This move will allow for 10,000 more tickets to be sold for each of these games, as the United Center has almost twice the capacity of Wintrust Arena. Plus, Carrick Rangers F.C. Owner Michael W. Smith stops by the show to talk about the Northern Ireland Football League club. He also discusses both the global growth of small-market teams as well as the unique ways the team raises funds and remains profitable.

            "headline": "Just days before the 2024 election, President Donald Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, accusing the media giant of editing an interview with former Vice President and election rival Kamala Harris. While initially dismissed as a long shot, reports suggest that CBS-parent company Paramount Global (PARAA, PARA) is now considering a settlement to avoid interference in its merger with Skydance Media. MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman joins Market Domination to explain that the challenges in linear TV \u2014 particularly with weak advertising and cord-cutting trends by viewers \u2014 will force media companies to consolidate. \"Clearly there's complications depending on which asset we're talking about or which company we're talking about. But, at the same time, these companies are going to be forced to go down that direction the more that the pressure builds,\" Fishman says. \"It's going to be the fundamentals that drive the decision, not just the need for consolidation for any other reason.\" Fishman also mentions that while industry fundamentals may drive consolidation, it may also be influenced by the current regulatory stances the Trump administration seems to be displaying.
